# Calculator

**A calculator iOS web app.**

[Install the app](http://philbuchanan.com/calculator/).

## Support

The current version has been fully tested on iOS 9 running on iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+. It should *work* on iOS 7 and 8, but iOS 9 is highly recommended.

## Features

- full standard calculator functions
- brackets
- invert individual numbers (+/-)
- backspace
- 50 item calculation history
- HTML5 app caching (so it'll work offline)

### History

Every time you tap the equals button the result of the current equation is saved to the history list. The list can store up to 100 recent items.

Any history item can be used in the current equation by simply tapping on it in the history list.

The history can be cleared by simply tapping and holding on the history close button for a few seconds.

### HTML5 App Caching

The app will function completely without any sort of internet connection. The entire app state is saved between app runs as well.

If an internet connection is present, the app will automatically check for updates. If any updates are available it will download them and new bug fixes and features will be available on the next app run.
